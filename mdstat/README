Mail Delivery Statistics Tool (mdstat) is an easy way to inform you the working
result of the SMTP daemon on your server via HTML formatted report.
By counting the SMTP mail delivery result log, mdstat can report the statistics 
of the delivery status and percentage information in an HTML-style table.
An individual configuration file is seperated to provide more flexible of the 
tool.

Note: If you run mdstat via crond, pay attention to the configuration file location in the script file, or the configuration file will not be load correctly.
